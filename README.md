# Library_Management_System
A simple Library Management project using EmberJS, NodeJS, Express and PostgreSQL database.

Notes:
1. Compile Ember application and place it in public folder in root directory.
2. Install PostgreSQL database.
3. Install Node.js and Express.
4. For Ember related instructions, see ReadMe file in Ember folder.

This application maintains a database of books and their details in a library and can perform the following operations.
1. Add Book
2. Update Book
3. View all Books
4. Delete Book
5. Search Book

I've also planned to integrate many other features in this application.
